# MZ Urisa Digital Competition 2023 Source Code
This repository contains the code for the web application and machine learning code for the Urisa Digital Competition 2023.<br/>
The code produced for this competition was to predict the crime in Baltimore, MD, USA from 2023 to 2033. This required a machine learning model (produced in Python) that conducted the computations necessary to generate predictions. There was also a means to host the resulting predictions, thus a web application was produced to visualize the results and allow a given user to interact with the information. <br/>
The web application code is also hosted via JSBin found [here](https://output.jsbin.com/fazozin).
